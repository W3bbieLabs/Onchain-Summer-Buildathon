### üí° Why we Created Public Goods Club

We're a community of public goods enthusiasts and our mission is simple: to fund badass public goods projects. Public Goods Club is working from this epiphany: the coolest projects were funding public goods. Think Pizza DAO ‚Äì turning pizza into a public good. Or Nouns ‚Äì sparking creative ideas. And the Artist Program ‚Äì funding cc0 art.

Our goal is to achieve a new and creative way to fund public goods. We're giving out grants for creative public goods projects, whether they‚Äôre big or small, with our community‚Äôs backing. We‚Äôre also making it super simple for people outside of web3 to dive in onchain.

### üõ§Ô∏è Tracks We're On

#### Gaming Track
We developed an IRL Token-based gaming experience by creating an ERC-271 Member token using thirdweb's NFT Collection contract. These tokens were symbolized as game characters, a functionality made possible through account abstraction, which is commonly used in gaming to handle inventory management; which was implemented using an ERC 6551 contract.
  
#### Coinbase Smart Wallet
We created smart wallet functionality using Thirdweb's v5 SDK. Our main mint and inventory page leverage smart wallet connection options, easing process of wallet creation.

### üé® Aesthetics

#### Design & Branding
Public Goods Club branding is a modern take on the [Pharrell:Milo Game](https://web.archive.org/web/20080723202703/http://www.pharrellwilliams.com/game/). Color wise, we have chosen a blue environment in alignment with Base's color theme. We even made our [own version of the Onchain Summer Billboard](https://zora.co/collect/base:0xa6735cb18ea3e233c535dacd7276d64db02fd9e3/1) as a mintable collectible. And as far as typography goes, [Lineal](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/lineal/) was used for its capacity as an expressive sans-serif, conveying a feeling of freshness.

#### Character Design
Our PFP character design features over 65M generative outputs, thanks to a range of custom-feeling anatomical elements.
