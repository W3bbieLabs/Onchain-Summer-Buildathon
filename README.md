### 💡 Why we Created Public Goods Club

We're a community of public goods enthusiasts and our mission is simple: to fund badass public goods projects. Public Goods Club is working from this epiphany: the coolest projects were funding public goods. Think Pizza DAO – turning pizza into a public good. Or Nouns – sparking creative ideas. And the Artist Program – funding cc0 art.

Our goal is to achieve a new and creative way to fund public goods. We're giving out grants for creative public goods projects, whether they’re big or small, with our community’s backing. We’re also making it super simple for people outside of web3 to dive in onchain.
